**Private Endpoint: It brings the service into your virtual network.** It's a network interface created that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. The service could be almost any available in Azure:

* Azure Storage
    
* Azure Cosmos DB
    
* Azure SQL Database
    

The **private endpoint must be deployed in the same region and subscription as the virtual network.**

**Private Link** â€“ The umbrella Azure service under which you can make your PaaS resources available privately on a virtual network.
