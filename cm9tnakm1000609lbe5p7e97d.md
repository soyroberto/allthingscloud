According to Gartner, **Enterprise Architecture is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change** by creating, communicating, and improving the key principles and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution10 . DoDAF defines it as **a set of abstractions and models that simplify and communicate complex structures, processes, rules, and constraints to improve understanding, implementation, forecasting, and resourcing**

## Why does DoDAF has an architecture framework?

DoDAF has an architecture framework because the US Department of Defense (DoD) recognised the need for a structured approach to manage its complex structures and information.

Here's a breakdown of why DoDAF has an architecture framework:

The **TOGAF Standard, Version 1, was originally based on the US Department of Defense Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM)**1 .... This indicates that the DoD, the entity behind what we now know as DoDAF, saw the value in having a technical architecture framework as early as 1995.

TAFIM was the result of significant development effort and investment by the US Government. This foundational work highlights the DoD's early understanding of the importance of a structured approach to architecture.

**Work in progress**
