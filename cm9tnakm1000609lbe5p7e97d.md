According to Gartner, **Enterprise Architecture is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change** by creating, communicating, and improving the key principles and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution10 . DoDAF defines it as **a set of abstractions and models that simplify and communicate complex structures, processes, rules, and constraints to improve understanding, implementation, forecasting, and resourcing**

## Why does DoDAF has an architecture framework?

DoDAF has an architecture framework because the US Department of Defense (DoD) recognised the need for a structured approach to manage its complex structures and information.

Here's a breakdown of why DoDAF has an architecture framework:

The \*\*TOGAF Standard, Version 1, was originally based on the US Department of Defense Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM)\*\*1 .... This indicates that the DoD, the entity behind what we now know as DoDAF, saw the value in having a technical architecture framework as early as 1995.

TAFIM was the result of significant development effort and investment by the US Government. This foundational work highlights the DoD's early understanding of the importance of a structured approach to architecture.

# **An overview of TOGAF**

Think of **TOGAF as a comprehensive and open framework for Enterprise Architecture (EA)** it's a **standard way of developing, approving, using, and looking after your Enterprise Architecture**, it can be used across all sorts of EA work

## Here's a quick rundown of the key bits:

* **Framework for EA:** At its heart, TOGAF provides the structure, methods, and tools you need to build and manage an effective **Enterprise Architecture**
    
* **Standard Approach:** It offers a consistent and repeatable way to tackle EA, ensuring that everyone's on the same page when it comes to development, approval, and ongoing maintenance
    
* **Open and Consensus-Driven:** TOGAF is an open standard, meaning it's publicly available and has been developed through the collaboration of industry experts within **The Open Group**
    
    **Universally Applicable:** It's designed to be relevant no matter the industry, size, or how fast things are changing in your organisation. Whether you're dealing with strategy, projects, digital transformation, or legacy systems, TOGAF's got you covered
