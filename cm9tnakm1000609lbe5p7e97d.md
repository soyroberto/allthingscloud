According to Gartner, **Enterprise Architecture is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change** by creating, communicating, and improving the key principles and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution10 . DoDAF defines it as **a set of abstractions and models that simplify and communicate complex structures, processes, rules, and constraints to improve understanding, implementation, forecasting, and resourcing**
